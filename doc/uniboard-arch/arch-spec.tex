\chapter{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This document presents the architectural specification of \uniboard,
a (rather) universal public bulletin board. Specific to this
architecture specification is that it defines the \emph{standalone},
monolithic as well as the \emph{distributed} variant of the
public bulletin board.

To achieve this, the following architectural goals have been in mind:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The same specification for the architecture
		of the \emph{standalone} and the \emph{distributed}
		variant of \uniboard.
	\item Establishment of a \emph{component composition} in
		order to achieve the desired functionality.
	\item Plug-in facility to switch from the standalone variant
		to the distributed one, and vice versa.
\end{itemize}

Note that the supported properties of \uniboard\ depend of the combination of components used.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Component Composition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In (Ref.\ to be provided), several properties and the basic operations of a public bulletin
board have been identified. We present in this document the
specification of a software architecture allowing to implement
these properties by \emph{composition} of respective building
blocks, the so-called \emph{components}. A
\emph{chain of components} is used as the pattern for the
composition.

\uniboard\ consist of one node (for the standalone variant) or
a set of nodes (for the distributed variant). For the
distributed variant, a specific component is inserted
into the chain of components. That component implements
the respective agreement protocol by communicating with
peer nodes.

Each component implements the same generic service interface.
This allows the desired chain of components. (Of
course, not every arbitrary combination of components results
in a useful configuration.) The final component in this chain
is a persistence service allowing to store information, and
to retrieve it later. In fact, our architecture follows the
\emph{chain of responsibility pattern} \cite{Gamma:1995:DPE:186897}.


\section{Chain of Components}

In order to achieve upmost flexibility, all components of
\uniboard\ implement the very same \emph{generic} service
interface, simply called \emph{Service} (namespaces in text
omitted for brevity). That is, each component (indirectly)
implements this interface. This interface is deduced from the 
basic operations of a bulletin board.

The chain of components is achieved by linking a component
to the next one, which in turn is linked to another component.
Only the last component in the chain, the \emph{PersistenceService}, is not
linked anymore to another component. \fig{fig:chain-of-components}
shows the static structure. This chain is 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/chain-of-components}}
\caption{UML class diagram defining the interface and linking
of the components. Each component implements the same generic
interface. The Component class, as shown, is abstract. That
implies that concrete components subclass the abstract
Component class.}
\label{fig:chain-of-components}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Service} interface consists of two
general-purpose methods, \emph{post} and \emph{get}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=javastyle]
package ch.bfh.uniboard;

public interface Service {
    public Attributes post(byte[] message, Attributes alpha, Attributes beta);
    public ResultContainer get(Query query);
}
\end{lstlisting}

Not only the interface is rather generic, but also the provided
and returned data containers \emph{Attributes},
\emph{Query}, and \emph{ResultContainer}. The introduction of generic
data containers minimizes the coupling: Components depend on
the core classes only, but not on specific classes of other
components. See (TODO: Provide Ref.\ to be provided) for
a more detailed elaboration on this topic.

The meaning of the data abstractions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Attributes:} List of attributes, where each attribute is computed
		by the author or a component. These attributes belong either to a message or result.
	\item \emph{Query:} Data that originates from an author
		for a \emph{get} operation. The \emph{Query} defines the set of posts that are returned as the result.
	\item \emph{ResultContainer:} Consists of two parts. First there is a set of posts that satisfies the \emph{Query}, and there are \emph{Attributes} for this result. Every component may add an attribute. The result is set by the final component, the persistence store.
\end{itemize}


\section{Service Request Delegation}

At start-up time, a board is configured by a number
of concrete components arranged in a chain of component
instances. To service a client, there is at first a \emph{BulletinBoardService}. This service
provides the interface for the client.  It forwards the request to the first
component, which passes it to the next component. It may also process the
service request before passing it to the next
component. Consequently, it may also process the
response before returning it to the \emph{BulletinBoardService}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/service-request-delegation}}
\caption{UML sequence diagram illustrating the dynamics of the
delegation of a service request. Each \emph{post()} request received
at a component is processed at first internally by the
self-delegated method \emph{beforePost()}, and then passed to
the next downstream component. The response of the downstream
component is processed at first by the self-delegated
method \emph{afterPost()}, and then returned to the calling
component (or the application).}
\label{fig:service-request-delegation}
\end{figure}

The above described behavioral pattern is repeated with
every intermediate component. Notice that \emph{synchronous} calls
are used between the components.
However, asynchronous processing may occur within
a component, which will likely be the case for the
distributed variant of the board.

\section{Handling Service Requests}

A \emph{BulletinBoardService} or a component requests a service provided by
the downstream component. Basically, the following three
processing actions will occur in the downstream component:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The received request is processed.
	\item The processed request is passed to the downstream
		component.
	\item The result of the downstream component is
		processed and returned to the calling
		component (or the application).
\end{enumerate}

The comments of \fig{fig:chain-of-components} sketch
the above described processing actions. The template \cite{Gamma:1995:DPE:186897}
of this behavior is predefined in the abstract class Component:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=javastyle]
package ch.bfh.uniboard.service;

public abstract class Component implements Service {
    private Service successor;

	public final Attributes post(byte[] message, Attributes alpha, Attributes beta) {
		Attributes beforePost = this.beforePost(message, alpha, beta);
		...
		Attributes betaReceived = this.getSuccessor().post(message, alpha, beforePost);
		this.afterPost(message, alpha, betaReceived);
		return betaReceived;
	}
    public finalResultContainer get(Query query) {
        // analogous to method post() above
    }
    protected Attributes beforePost(byte[] message, Attributes alpha, Attributes beta) {
        return beta;
    }
    protected void afterPost(byte[] message, Attributes alpha, Attributes beta) {
    }
    // analogous for methods beforeGet() and afterGet()
}
\end{lstlisting}

Subclasses needing to process a message before passing it
to the downstream component merely overwrite method
\emph{beforePost()}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=javastyle]
package lu.unilu.uniboard.component_x;

import ch.bfh.uniboard.service.*;

public class Component_X extends Component {
    ...
    protected Attributes beforePost(byte[] message, Attributes alpha, Attributes beta) {
        // process given message and attributes
        // (or pass back modified attributes object, not shown)
        return beta;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Similarly, subclasses overwrite methods \emph{afterPost()},
\emph{beforeGet()}, and \emph{afterGet()} in order to implement
the desired behavior.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Specific Services}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to implement the desired properties of the public bulletin board,
 a number of concrete services are required:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{BulletinBoardService} This is an abstract view
		of \uniboard. Different type of technologies may be used
		for implementing this service in order to access
		\uniboard. However, web service
		technology (WSDL, SOAP) will be the primary choice.
	\item \emph{Property Service} This service provides properties required by the bulletin board. Its
		realization is composed of a series of property
		implementation, all adhering to the very same
		\emph{Service} interface, exploiting the pluggable
		layered architecture.
	\item \emph{Persistence Service} This service provides
		the view to the persistence storage of the postings
		sent to \uniboard.
\end{itemize}

Some details of the \emph{fault tolerance service} will be described
in the next chapter. Course views for a \emph{property service}
and the \emph{persistence service} are given in the next sections.

TODO: Provide details on accessing the bulletin board.


\section{A Service Implementing a Property}

The public bulletin board requires a number of properties. Our
architecture implies that each property is realized within
one component. Since a component requires the service of
the downstream component, a downstream component is
linked with the component automatically; the necessary
code is inherited from the subclass \emph{Component}.

\fig{fig:authorization-service} shows the structure of
the authorization service.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/authorization-service}}
\caption{UML class diagram for the illustration of the
authorization service component. Notice that it is derived
from the \emph{Component} class which implies that there
is a downstream component link to this component.}
\label{fig:authorization-service}
\end{figure}


\section{The Persistence Service}

The persistence service provides operations to store and
retrieve data. It is a component in the sense that it
implements the \emph{Service} interface. However, it
does not any downstream component and, thus, cannot be
derived from the \emph{Component} abstraction.

\fig{fig:persistence-service} shows the structure of the persistence service
component.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/persistence-service}}
\caption{UML class diagram for the illustration of the
persistence service component. Notice that it merely implements
the \emph{Service} interface, and that it is not derived
from the \emph{Component} class.}
\label{fig:persistence-service}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Distributed Bulletin Board}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapters explains how a bulletin board is built as
a distributed system. The distributed system consists of
a set of nodes. Each node is assumed to be configured
accordingly.

The architectural model also assumes that a message to
be published is sent to one (trusted) node. (If the
application does not trust a given node then it can
choose among the other ones.) The message then is
processed by the Byzantine fault tolerant client
component \emph{BFTClient}. The BFT client component in turn
may use downstream components, and it will have
to use peers, the so called Byzantine fault tolerant
replica components of sort \emph{BFTReplica}.


\section{BFT Client Component}

In its first view, a \emph{BFTClient} acts as a component.
That is, it subclasses the generic component class
\emph{Component}. As such, it may use the service of
the successor (local) component. However, it will also
initiate an agreement protocol with peer replica
components of sort \emph{BFTReplica}. \fig{fig:byzantine-client}
shows the static structure of the Byzantine fault tolerant client
component.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/byzantine-client}}
\caption{UML class diagram illustrating the client side
of the replication component. Class \emph{BFTClient} extends the
\emph{Component} class. In addition, it uses the remote service
accessible via the \emph{BFTReplica} interface.}
\label{fig:byzantine-client}
\end{figure}


\section{BFT Replica Component}

Primarily, a Byzantine fault tolerant replica
component of sort \emph{BFTReplica} extends the
generic \emph{Component} implementation. In addition,
it also implements the \emph{BFTReplica} interface.
\fig{fig:byzantine-replica} shows
the static structure of the Byzantine fault tolerant replica
component.


\begin{figure}[ht<]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/byzantine-replica}}
\caption{UML class diagram illustrating the replication side
of the replica component. Class \emph{BFTReplicaComponent}
extends the \emph{Component} class (and, thus, is a \emph{Service}). In
addition, it implements the \emph{BFTReplica} interface providing
specific services to peer replica clients.}
\label{fig:byzantine-replica}
\end{figure}

The communication between the BFT client and the BFT replicas
is an implementation detail and, therefore, not discussed here.
(It may involve yet another layered architecture and specialized
protocols, and it will use whatever communication technology
is appropriate.)


\section{Deployment View of the Replicated Board}

For the replicated configuration, each node is identically
configured with a set of required \emph{Component} instances, and
with the BFT client and BFT replica component instances.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Implementation Hints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some implementation hints are given here.

\section{Namespaces, Names}

\begin{quote}
	\emph{Note.} The namespace \emph{org.uniboard} is already
	used in the domain name system of the Internet. Thus,
	we will have to discuss its use here.
\end{quote}

In order to ease the setup of the code base (project structure,
Maven artifacts, names to be defined), certain namespaces must be fixed.
The following namespace for the core service abstraction shall
be used:

\begin{lstlisting}
package org.uniboard.core;

public interface Service ...
public abstract class Component ...
public abstract class Request ...
public abstract class Response ...
public abstract class Query ...
public abstract class Result ...
\end{lstlisting}

Implementations will use additional namespaces such as
\emph{lu.unilu.uniboard.component1},
\emph{lu.unilu.uniboard.application1},
\emph{ch.bfh.uniboard.application2}, or
\emph{ch.bfh.uniboard.component2}.

Class names can also be concretized by following respective
technology conventions. When using EJB, the convention for
session bean classes is to use the suffix \emph{Bean}.


\section{Access to the Downstream Component}

In order to achieve upper-most flexibility, is is mandatory to
access the next downstream component by using the \emph{generic}
service interface. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
package org.uniboard.core;

import javax.ejb.EJB;
import javax.ejb.LocalBean;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;

@Stateless
@LocalBean
public abstract class ComponentBean implements Service {

    @EJB
    private Service successor; // injected by the EJB container

    public Response post(Message message) ... {
        Message beforePost = beforePost(message);
        Response response = successor.post(beforePost);
        Response afterPost = afterPost(response);
        return afterPost;
    }
    ...
    protected Message beforePost(Message message) ... {
        return message;
    }
    protected Response afterPost(Response response) ... {
        return result;
    }
 }
\end{lstlisting}

Notice: By giving the component class the name \emph{ComponentBean}
we follow the propose name convention of EJB (TODO: Ref.\ to be
provided).

The injection performed by the container can be configured at
deploy-time. If EAR deployment units are used then the original
deployment descriptors or annotations can be overridden upon
configuring the EAR deployment unit.


\section{Skeleton for a Concrete Component}

The skeleton of a concrete component looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
package ch.bfh.uniboard.authorization;

import org.uniboard.core.Service;
import org.uniboard.core.ComponentBean;

@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class AuthorizationServiceBean extends ComponentBean {
    // overwrite beforePost(), afterPost() accordingly
    // overwrite beforeGet(), afterGet() accordingly
}
\end{lstlisting}

Another example:

\begin{lstlisting}
package lu.unilu.uniboard.byzantine;

import org.uniboard.core.Service;
import org.uniboard.core.ComponentBean;

@Stateless
@LocalBean
public class BFTClientBean extends ComponentBean {
    // overwrite beforePost(), afterPost() accordingly
    // overwrite beforeGet(), afterGet() accordingly
}
\end{lstlisting}


\section{A Simple Scheme for Data Containers}

Application and components use the generic data containers
as described above (TODO Ref.\ to be provided) for the
communication of information to components. This is to keep a high
degree of flexibility and to reduce the coupling between
components.

The following flexible scheme for the implementation of generic
data containers shall be used:

\begin{lstlisting}
package org.uniboard.core;

import java.util.*;
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Message implements Serializable {
    private Map<String, Object> entries = new HashMap<>();
    public void put(String key, Object value) {...}
    public Object get(String key) {...}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Keys are strings to be agreed among components and application
programmers. (TODO: Envision a pre-defined set of keys.)
The types of the values are also
agreed among components and application programmers.
In order to reduce the
coupling, basic types and Java system types should be used.

Here is a sketch of code illustrating how components access
the information in, for example, a \emph{Message} container:

\begin{lstlisting}
    // in a component class
    @Override
    protected Message beforePost(Message message) ... {
        String id = (String) message.get("IDENTITY");
        byte[] signatureHashValue = (byte[]) message.get("SIGHASH");
        ...
        // Create new message, fill new message m accordingly...
        // Alternatively, the given message object may be updated...
        Message m = new Message();
        // Add information... Then:
        return m;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

The above sketch shows how keys (here \emph{IDENTITY} or \emph{SIGHASH})
can be used, and that applications or components must agree on
the types of values (here \emph{String} or \emph{byte[]}).
